This project designs a mobile manipulators for indoor human environments can serve as versatile devices that perform a variety of tasks. The exterior design consists of a two-wheeled differential drive mobile base, a lift, and a telescoping arm configured to achieve Cartesian motion at the end of the arm. The robot is equipped with stereo cameras for mapping and trajectory planning in 3D. Semantic-SLAM and a graph based object encoder is used to achieve like-human intelligence.
